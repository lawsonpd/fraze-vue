# fraze-vue

Fraze is a clone of the popular hand-held game [Catchphrase](https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/catch-phrase-game:2C79D3B5-5056-9047-F535-614A0B4DE1C0), where two teams alternate guessing the word shown on the screen and the team _not_ guessing when the timer runs out wins a point.

This game is built with Vue.js and queries the [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/) API for random idioms.
